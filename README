xftp is meant to make uploads to your XBMC easy. 

If your xbox has been fitted with a larger hard drive it makes sense to want to different kinds of media on it.

Currently xftp is only suited to upload video files. Use the configuration file to setup xftp for your XBMC. It's written with some defaults to one of the following places:

Windows: C:\xftp.txt
Linux: /home/user/xftp.yml

To try out your connection just type xftp at the command line.
